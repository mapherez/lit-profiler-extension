# Lit Profiler DevTools Extension

This project provides a proof of concept DevTools extension to profile
[Lit](https://lit.dev/) applications. It is scaffolded with Vite and React
and currently contains a very small placeholder UI.

## Getting Started

```bash
cd extension
npm install
npm run build
```

Load the `extension/dist` folder as an unpacked extension in Chrome to try it
out. After loading, a **Lit Profiler** tab will appear inside DevTools.
